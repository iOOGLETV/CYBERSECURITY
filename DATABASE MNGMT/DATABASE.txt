10 rows selected.

5) Create a view called Total_sales, which show each customer and 
total_value of orders placed by it. Now report the customer no and name
for the customer and total_value for the customer who placed the highest
total_value of orders. Name the total orders value for a customer as total_value.
Show the view with all customers, as well as the report with the details of the
top customer.

SQL> create view Total_values as
  2  select c.customer_num, customer_name, sum(quoted_price*num_ordered) as total_value
  3  from customer c join orders o
  4  on c.customer_num = o.customer_num
  5  join order_line ol
  6  on ol.order_num = o.order_num
  7  group by c.customer_num, customer_name
  8  order by total_value;

View created.

SQL> select * from total_values;

6) In SP table, report the total target and total sales and total_shortfall
for each zone. Optional: look up (a horizontal acting) Oracle function greatest
(on google), use it in a query to report SPNUM, Zone, target, sales, shortfall
(setting the shortfall amount to zero if its negative-through parameters(shortfall,0))
Here, zero will be greater if the shortfall is negative, therefore, the function
will report zero.

SQL> select zone, sum(target) as total_target, sum(sales) as total_sales, sum(target-sales) as total_shortfall
  2  from sptable
  3  group by zone
  4  ;

SQL> select spnum, zone, target, sales, greatest((target-sales),0) as shortfall
  2  from sptable;

     SPNUM       ZONE     TARGET      SALES  SHORTFALL

Part B
1) Permit joshi to update your employee table. Allow select to All
on your inventory table.

GRANT UPDATE ON EMPLOYEE TO JOSHI;
GRANT SELECT ON INVENTORY TO PUBLIC;

2) Add a character type column ZIP with 5 character positions to
Employee table

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE ADD ZIP CHAR(5);

3) Now change the width of ZIP to 10 characters in Employee.

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE MODIFY ZIP CHAR(10);

4) Create an Index on the primary key of Order_line table.
Create another index on the Num_Ordered in the same table.

CREATE INDEX ORDERPART ON ORDER_LINE(ORDER_NUM, PART_NUM);
CREATE INDEX NUMORDERED ON ORDER_LINE(NUM_ORDERED);

5) Increase Num_Ordered in Order_line table for all HW class
parts by 20%.

UPDATE ORDER_LINE
SET NUM_ORDERED = NUM_ORDERED * 1.20
WHERE PART_NUM IN (SELECT PART_NUM
		   FROM PART
		   WHERE CLASS = 'HW');

6) Delete representative with REP_NUM 65.

DELETE FROM REP WHERE REP_NUM = 65;
